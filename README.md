## üöÄ **Description**

The term fractal was Ô¨Årst used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974, he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured". _**A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale**_.

This project will be the opportunity for you to hone your miniLibX skills, to make you discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.

The minilibx is a small C library used for rendering graphics, primarily used by 42 students. More information about the library you can find in the "Useful links" section.

```
  ./fractol [fractal name]
